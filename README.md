# Fake-News-Detection-
This project aims to address the growing concern of fake news propagation on digital platforms
by applying machine learning techniques to classify news articles as either real or fake. Fake
news is a significant societal issue, as it can misinform the public and influence important
decisions. The study will utilize the &quot;Fake News Classification&quot; dataset from Kaggle, which
contains labeled news articles from various sources. The primary objective is to develop and
evaluate machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Long Short-
Term Memory (LSTM) networks for fake news detection. Through preprocessing techniques and
exploratory data analysis, the project will explore word frequencies, text lengths, and class
distribution to understand patterns in fake and real news articles.

About Dataset
(WELFake) is a dataset of 72,134 news articles with 35,028 real and 37,106 fake news. For this, authors merged four popular news datasets (i.e. Kaggle, McIntire, Reuters, BuzzFeed Political) to prevent over-fitting of classifiers and to provide more text data for better ML training.

Dataset contains four columns: Serial number (starting from 0); Title (about the text news heading); Text (about the news content); and Label (0 = fake and 1 = real).

There are 78098 data entries in csv file out of which only 72134 entries are accessed as per the data frame.
